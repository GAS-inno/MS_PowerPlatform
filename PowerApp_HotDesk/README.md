### My Learning Journey  
This is the **first project** I built by following April Dunnamâ€™s YouTube videos and GitHub guide. Through this, I got introduced to **PowerApps, Power Automate, and the broader Microsoft Power Platform**â€”and I found it exciting and powerful technology!  

### Modifications I Made  
I have made some enhancements, including:  
- **Additional dropdown button in the "Manage Desks" section**  
  - Users can now select **two sides of a desk** in the office.  
  - Added an option to select a **Room** for better visibility when making reservations.
